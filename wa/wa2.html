        <p>I am an avid adventurer and am probably outside doing something dangerous right now. I am an inventor and innovator, and I am always questioning the world around me. I am a skier and ski designer, and I guess an entrepreneur of sorts. I am a very beginner web designer, but hopefully after this course I will be competent enough to make a basic, polished website.</p>
